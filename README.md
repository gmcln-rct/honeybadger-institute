# Honey Badger Institute

Honey Badger Institute is a web app to help beginner programmers to learn JavaScript, React, CSS and other frontend tools, through tough, Honey Badger-style love.

## Motivation
The goal of this app was to use React Hooks and Context API in a new way, while also creating a useful learning tool for frontend developers.

## Technologies

* React Hooks
* Context API
* SCSS
* Flexbox
* CSS Animations

## Build status

Honeybadger Institute is a work-in-progress. The functionality is still being built out and more questions are being added. (More Honey Badger attitude is being added as well.)
