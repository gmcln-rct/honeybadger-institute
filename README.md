# Honey Badger Institute

The Honey Badger Institute of Higher Learning is a web app created to help rookie programmers test their knowledge of JavaScript, React, CSS and other frontend tools, through tough, Honey Badger-style love. The app uses React Hooks and Contexxt API, as well as SCSS and Flexbox.

## Motivation
The goal of this app was to use React Hooks and Context API in a new way, while also creating a useful learning tool for frontend developers.

## Technologies

* React Hooks
* Context API
* SCSS
* Flexbox
* CSS Animations

## Build status

The Honey Badger Institute is a work-in-progress -- both in terms of functionality and the number of questions. (More Honey Badger attitude is being added as well.)
